			<h3>About Bob</h3>
	        <p>Thanks for stopping by. Allow me to give you a little background about myself while your here. In late 2010 I, and many of my co-workers, were laid off from our positions at a building materials firm. I had worked there for over 11 years in the engineering department, reviewing and approving plans for wood trusses used in both residential and commercial buildings. I left with a lot of knowledge of wood trusses and it's industry, but with competitors and clients downsizing and closing due to the housing construction bust, I realized that this was an excellent opportunity to shift my career into a new direction. Sudden life changes will help you self evaluate and I was always curious about building websites and programming. I always thought that it would be fun. I love solving problems, I love learning, and I love building things(there's still some engineering in me). So I began teaching myself how to build websites.</p> 
	        <p>I had never even heard of HTML or CSS and was soon watching videos, setting up my text editor, and running my first bits of code through my browser. I was hooked. The simplest things were fascinating, changing colors from blue to red, changing fonts, everything was so cool and fun. I wanted to learn more, I read a ton of articles on being a good web developer and eventually stumbled upon frameworks. This sounded perfect, I could get up and running with a full site in no time. I decided to learn Ruby on Rails. Now I had no friends or family that knew anything about web development and I regrettably had no mentors to tell me that going from HTML/CSS to Rails might be a bad idea, but I didn't know any better and I jumped right in. So I went through some Rails tutorials and built some cool things, but I wasn't quite grasping some of the concepts such as programming flow, abstraction, even building functions was confusing. I then learned about WordPress and began building sites using that. I hacked together quite a few sites using other people's plugins and themes and deep down knew that this wasn't professional web development.</p> 
	        <p>The whole goal for me was to get a development job somewhere and I began getting interviews. Part of my problem was not knowing what I didn't know or worse not knowing how much I knew. I met some cool people along the way that would give me advice and keep me going. One person I interviewed for asked if I had ever heard of Rockit Bootcamp in Tempe and thought it would be a really good program for me. Rockit Bootcamp is a very intense 12 week full stack development course and it seemed like a great opportunity. So I joined the bootcamp in January of 2015 and completed it in April. Rockit helped me fill in all of the gaps. I learned semantic HTML, proper CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, MySQL, PHP, Object Oriented Programming, Encapsulation, AJAX, Laravel, SCRUM, and a whole slew of other technologies and proper techniques in professional web development.</p>
	        <p>Today I am still seeking that development job. In the meantime, I'm still learning as much as I can and trying to become a better developer everyday. It has become a true passion. I am spending more time learning Laravel and have started working on some projects for AthleTech Software, a startup that my friend and I have started. Below is a more thorough breakdown of some of the skills I have learned on this journey and continue to learn more about.</p>
