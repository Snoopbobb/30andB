        <p>Prior to Rockit Bootcamp, I was learning web development on my own. During this time I learned HTML, CSS, Ruby on Rails, Wordpress,
        Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe Illustrator.</p>
        <h3>I love working with technology</h3>
        <p>I have always been fascinated by technolgy and always wished I knew how to build websites and software. The more I learn, the more
        I realize there is to learn, and the more I want to learn. I am currently seeking a position with an organization that will allow me to 
        continue my learning while pushing me to become a better developer and programmer everyday. I love being challenged and I love working
        with people and companies that are passionate and positive. Thank you so much for visiting. I hope to hear from you soon.</p>
