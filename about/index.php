        <h3>About</h3>
        <p>Since January of 2012, I have been busy teaching myself web design and development with a goal to become a full stack developer.  
        My top skills right now include Wordpress, HTML, CSS, Adobe Illustrator, and Adobe Photoshop.  I also have experience with PHP, MYSQL, 
        JavaScript, jQuery, Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL, Git, Console, XAMMP, and FTP.  My favorite IDE's and text editors are Sublime Text 3, 
        PHPStorm, and RubyMine. I have also worked a little with HTML5 Boilerplate, Foundation 5, and Bootstrap. Everyday I try to learn something new or get
        better at something I've already learned.</p>
        <h3>What I Will Do For You</h3>
        <ul>
          <dt>Finisher</dt>
            <dd>I'll do what it takes to get the job done.  I don't know everything, but I will find the answer to anything I don't know quickly.
            Being resourceful and efficient, are some of my natural skills.
            </dd>
          <dt>Ambitious</dt>
            <dd>I love learning new things and pushing myself to reach goals that may seem difficult.  I knew absolutely nothing about web design or development when I started teaching myself the skills needed to become a professional developer. 
            </dd>
          <dt>Driven</dt>
            <dd>I've spent countless hours learning as much as I could about web design and development.  Most of the time I was eating, sleeping, and spending every moment I could trying to learn something new or brushing up on what I had already learned.  This was done with no one to answer to but myself, to challenge myself, and to restart my chosen career.
            </dd>
          <dt>Loyal</dt>
            <dd>I once worked for a building materials and engineering firm for over 11 years, riding it through the greatest building crash of our generation.  Unfortunately I was chewed up and spit out at the end of it.  It was a rough ride down to the bottom, but I bounced back up and was able to evaluate what I really wanted to do for the rest of my career.
            </dd>
          <dt>Teammate</dt>
            <dd> I love working as a member of a team.  Everyone driving toward the same goal and working together to help each other out with no drama, jealousy, or impedence.  I always loved to bunt, pick up blitzes, and get the assists.  Hitting homeruns and scoring touchdowns are fun too, but there's nothing better than winning as a team.
            </dd>
